                            <p>Mary Mitchell Slessor (2 December 1848 – 13 January 1915) was a heroine whose name has 
                                been etched in the hearts of many. Myriads of twins in Nigeria owe their existence to 
                                her benevolence and bravery. Born on 2nd December, 1848,  in Gilcomston, Aberdeen,
                                Scotland, Ma Slessor- as she was fondly called- would move to southeastern, Nigeria,
                                to lay a timeless impact on the community and the country at large. With her altruism,
                                she saved our world!</p>
